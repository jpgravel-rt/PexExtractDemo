## What is pexlib and why should I use it?

Pexlib is a python library that interfaces [Osisoft PI Web API](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-web-api-reference/page/help.html). It simplifies
querying PI tags over long period of time. Keep in mind though that pexlib is meant to be a massive
extractor. Another initiative based on pexlib is ongoing in Brisbane AU (PACE) to make it a stream
extractor but we won't address that subject in this document.

Unless you are at ease with Osisoft PI Web APIs, you know that doing raw HTTP requests in R and 
transforming JSON structures into R dataframes is somewhat hard. Pexlib fills the gap by exposing 
two easy-to-use methods:

  1) extractdf and;
  2) extract_dataframe.

Both return a pandas dataframe. One has all arguments required to connect to the server and do a
one shot extraction of one tag. The other expect to receive a connection parameter to optimize
multi-tag extractions.

This document assumes that you use RStudio Workbench Pro on a centralized server, not the desktop
version. But yeah you could still use the later if you know what you are doing.

## Lets install some useful libraries
```{r Libraries, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("reticulate", "dplyr"))
library(dplyr)
```


## On how to use pexlib within RStudio Workbench

First create a project with a significative name (File -\> New Project...). When the project name is asked, check the "Create a git repository" and "Use renv with this project" checkboxes.

![New Project](assets/NewProject.jpg "New Project")

*Note: While you are at it, why not use R version 4+? Give it a try, really.*

Then in a terminal window (terminal not the R Console) type the following commands:

```{bash Command Line, eval=FALSE}
python3 -m venv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
python -m pip install wheel setuptools
python -m pip install pexlib[pandas,kerberos]
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

You should have a `.Rprofile` file in your project directory. Open it and make sure to copy the
following content into it:

```{r Rprofile Code, eval=FALSE}
source("renv/activate.R")
pyenv_path <- paste0(getwd(), "/pyenv")
reticulate::use_virtualenv(pyenv_path, required = T)
rm(pyenv_path)
```

Install `reticulate`:

```{r Reticulate Installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

...and restart your R session.

Now lets create a new R Notebook and add some code

```{r R Notebook Header, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
reticulate::py_config()
```

Reticulate is a library that bridge the gap between R and python. It allows R programmer to use
python libraries seamlessly. Lets see if you can load `pexlib` into R now.

```{r Loading pexlib, eval=FALSE}
pexlib <- import("pexlib")

# Just setting some config values do not worry about these lines...
req <- reticulate::import("requests")
req$packages$urllib3$disable_warnings() 
rm(req)
```

## Obfuscation

Before we go, you need to be aware of one thing: password obfuscation. Obfuscated password can not
be easily decoded but it is still feasible; obfuscation is not encryption. Another user in
another session OR another server cannot de-obfuscate a password created from another user context.
Looking at an obfuscated password gives no clue about the password itself other than its 
approximate length.

This is how to obfuscate a password for pexlib:

```{r Obfuscating a Password, eval=FALSE}
pexlib$scrambler$obfuscate("password")
```
Another example:

```{r Another Example, eval=FALSE}
lapply(rep("Janvier2015", 3), function(password) {
  pexlib$scrambler$obfuscate(password)
}) %>% unlist()
```

Just wanted to show you that obfuscating the same string many times produce different results.
This is black magic! At the same time, you have witnessed the use of "lapply", one of the
vectorization functions available in R. Be wise and use vectorization instead of loops.

## One Shot Extraction using extractdf

`extractdf` has an exhaustive list of parameters:

```{python extractdf interface, eval=FALSE}
def extractdf(
        server: str,                                # The Pi Web API server address
        username: str,                              # Your username ex: CORP\\john.doe
        password: str,                              # Your password, can be obfuscated!
        path: str,                                  # The desired tag path
        start_time,                                 # ISO date time string
        end_time,                                   # ISO date time string
        sync_time,                                  # ISO date time string
        interval: str = "5s",                       # number foollowed by "s", "m", "h", "d" or "w"
        output_server: bool = False,                # If true, add the server name column 
        drop_duplicates: bool = False,              # Some compression
        stream: str = "Interpolated",               # "Interpolated", "Recorded", "Summary"
        summary_type: str = "Average",              # Ignored unless stream param is "Summary" 
                                                    #   Possible values: "Total", "Average", 
                                                    #   "Minimum", "Maximum", "StdDev", 
                                                    #   "PopulationStdDev", "Count", "PercentGood"
        batch_size: int = 150_000,                  # Do not play with this one plz
        ignore_creation_date: bool = False,         # May be handy in some cases (central PI)
        include_bad_values: bool = True):           # Keep or drop bad values (according to PI doc)
```


```{r extractdf example, eval=FALSE}
df <- pexlib$extractor$extractdf(
  "https://casagszwebpi1.corp.riotinto.org/piwebapi/",
  "CORP\\crda.courtoisie",
  "#:f+oxwF2Ti5RypUlg",
  "//JONQPI01/sinusoid",
  start_time = "2021-02-03 15:00:00",
  end_time   = "2021-02-04 03:00:00",
  sync_time  = "2021-02-03 15:00:00",
  interval   = "1m",
  stream     = "Summary",
  summary_type = "Average"
)
head(df)
```

It fails right? Do you recall what we said in the [Obfuscation](#obfuscation) section?
Obfuscation is specific to the current user environment. Try it again but before you do, copy the
obfuscated password from the multiple obfuscation example above.

Now did it work? If yes, you should have a nice dataframe with data coming from PI. Don't forget to
change the obfuscated password in the next example as well.

## Multi-tags Extraction Example

```{r Multi-tags Example, eval=FALSE}
client = pexlib$Client(
  "https://casagszwebpi1.corp.riotinto.org/piwebapi/",
  "CORP\\crda.courtoisie",
  "#:3EmSY/4wKDfRBurD"                # Change me!
)

client$open()

# PI APIs work with ISO-8601 time shift. No ambiguity here but don't forget to account for daylight
# saving time when required (2nd Sunday of March / first Sunday of November). Are you querying data
# before 2007? Have fun!
tags <- c("//JONQPI01/410F142.PV", "//JONQPI01/BHB-WC-054.PV", "//JONQPI01/BO-DI-804.PV")
df2 <- lapply(tags, function(tag) {
  pexlib$extractor$extract_dataframe(client, tag,
    start_time = "2021-02-03 15:00:00-05:00",
    end_time   = "2021-02-04 03:00:00-05:00",
    sync_time  = "2021-02-03 15:00:00-05:00",
    interval   = "1m",
    stream     = "Recorded")
}) %>% bind_rows()

client$close()

# Setting time zone is important at the output. The default may not be what you expect. Especially
# when working on a server. Are you sure the server you deploy to has the time zone you expect?
attr(df2$ts, "tzone") <- "America/Toronto"  

df2 %>% 
  group_by(tag) %>%
  summarise(from=min(ts), to=max(ts), count=n(), avg=mean(numval), stddev=sd(numval))
```

## Date and Time Disambiguation

Dealing with datetime can become confusing quickly. To disambiguate the situation, always provide
the ISO-8601 time shift when passing datetime parameters to `pexlib`, then specify the time zone you
want to interpret the `ts` column in the returned dataframe. To know which time zones exist, call
`OlsonNames()` in your R console.

## Conclusion

This is basically all you need to know about `pexlib` extraction in R. You can now create your own
projects from the current examples. Be aware though that extracting a lot of data can be a big
burden on production servers and networks. If you need a huge extraction or if your code makes a
lot of small requests repeatedly, it might be a good idea to consult a friendly data engineer
near you to reduce the burden on our poor production systems.
